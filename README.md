# College Class Notifier (Freshman Project - Discontinued)

This project was completed during my freshman year of college. Its purpose was to automate the class registering process within my university (University of North Georgia). The front end of this program is customizable to allow the user to select which class(es) the user would like to monitor during that registration period. The program notifies a user via text that a desired class has opened, or that the desired class has been filled.
